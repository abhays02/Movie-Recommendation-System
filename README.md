Recommender systems are powerful techniques widely used to suggest items or 
products to users based on their preferences, aiming to enhance the user experience 
by offering personalized recommendations. These systems leverage various 
algorithms to predict which items a user might be interested in, drawing from 
historical data and patterns in user behavior. Collaborative filtering is one of the 
most popular approaches in recommender systems, where recommendations are 
made by analyzing the preferences and behaviors of similar users or items. Among 
the types of collaborative filtering, item-item-based collaborative filtering is a 
commonly used technique, where the system recommends items to a user based on 
the similarity in ratings between items.
